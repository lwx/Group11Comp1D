The chronicles of ALU:

ALU_Project V1.0 issues:
1. The comparator was implemented by directly using MOJO's logical comparisons.

 case(alufn[2:0]){ //values of alufn that define comparator function
    b001:
      cmp = (a==b);
    b010:
      cmp = (a<b); // 
    b011:
      cmp = (a<=b); // 
    b110:
      cmp = (a>b);
    b111:
      cmp = (a>=b);
      
    default:
      cmp = b0;
  }

  However, it has come to our attention that we were required to use Z,V and N. Hence we would have to rewrite the code 
  for computing Z,V and N as the inputs for  the comparator module.
  
  ALU_Project V1.1 issues:
  We reworked the Z,V and N outputs into the comparator's inputs.
  All other module's functionalities remain intact.
  However, there appeared to be issues with the computation of Z, V and N.
  
  ALU_Project_Finalized:
  We thus realized what the problem was:
  1. The bit assignment to the operation checker was wrong;
  check alufn[1:0] instead of [2:1]
  2. We forgot to perform a "forced subtraction on a and b".
  (Setting alufn[0] to 1), which caused the comparator to fail.
